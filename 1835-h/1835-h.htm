    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION TO JOE MULLER
    </h2>
    <p>
      Joseph Muller, Secret Service detective of the Imperial Austrian police,
      is one of the great experts in his profession. In personality he differs
      greatly from other famous detectives. He has neither the impressive
      authority of Sherlock Holmes, nor the keen brilliancy of Monsieur Lecoq.
      Muller is a small, slight, plain-looking man, of indefinite age, and of
      much humbleness of mien. A naturally retiring, modest disposition, and two
      external causes are the reasons for Muller&rsquo;s humbleness of manner, which
      is his chief characteristic. One cause is the fact that in early youth a
      miscarriage of justice gave him several years in prison, an experience
      which cast a stigma on his name and which made it impossible for him, for
      many years after, to obtain honest employment. But the world is richer,
      and safer, by Muller&rsquo;s early misfortune. For it was this experience which
      threw him back on his own peculiar talents for a livelihood, and drove him
      into the police force. Had he been able to enter any other profession, his
      genius might have been stunted to a mere pastime, instead of being, as
      now, utilised for the public good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, the red tape and bureaucratic etiquette which attaches to every
      governmental department, puts the secret service men of the Imperial
      police on a par with the lower ranks of the subordinates. Muller&rsquo;s
      official rank is scarcely much higher than that of a policeman, although
      kings and councillors consult him and the Police Department realises to
      the full what a treasure it has in him. But official red tape, and his
      early misfortune... prevent the giving of any higher official standing to
      even such a genius. Born and bred to such conditions, Muller understands
      them, and his natural modesty of disposition asks for no outward honours,
      asks for nothing but an income sufficient for his simple needs, and for
      aid and opportunity to occupy himself in the way he most enjoys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Muller&rsquo;s character is a strange mixture. The kindest-hearted man in
      the world, he is a human bloodhound when once the lure of the trail has
      caught him. He scarcely eats or sleeps when the chase is on, he does not
      seem to know human weakness nor fatigue, in spite of his frail body. Once
      put on a case his mind delves and delves until it finds a clue, then
      something awakes within him, a spirit akin to that which holds the
      bloodhound nose to trail, and he will accomplish the apparently
      impossible, he will track down his victim when the entire machinery of a
      great police department seems helpless to discover anything. The high
      chiefs and commissioners grant a condescending permission when Muller
      asks, &ldquo;May I do this? ... or may I handle this case this way?&rdquo; both
      parties knowing all the while that it is a farce, and that the department
      waits helpless until this humble little man saves its honour by solving
      some problem before which its intricate machinery has stood dazed and
      puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      This call of the trail is something that is stronger than anything else in
      Muller&rsquo;s mentality, and now and then it brings him into conflict with the
      department,... or with his own better nature. Sometimes his unerring
      instinct discovers secrets in high places, secrets which the Police
      Department is bidden to hush up and leave untouched. Muller is then taken
      off the case, and left idle for a while if he persists in his opinion as
      to the true facts. And at other times, Muller&rsquo;s own warm heart gets him
      into trouble. He will track down his victim, driven by the power in his
      soul which is stronger than all volition; but when he has this victim in
      the net, he will sometimes discover him to be a much finer, better man
      than the other individual, whose wrong at this particular criminal&rsquo;s hand
      set in motion the machinery of justice. Several times that has happened to
      Muller, and each time his heart got the better of his professional
      instincts, of his practical common-sense, too, perhaps,... at least as far
      as his own advancement was concerned, and he warned the victim, defeating
      his own work. This peculiarity of Muller&rsquo;s character caused his undoing at
      last, his official undoing that is, and compelled his retirement from the
      force. But his advice is often sought unofficially by the Department, and
      to those who know, Muller&rsquo;s hand can be seen in the unravelling of many a
      famous case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following stories are but a few of the many interesting cases that
      have come within the experience of this great detective. But they give a
      fair portrayal of Muller&rsquo;s peculiar method of working, his looking on
      himself as merely an humble member of the Department, and the comedy of
      his acting under &ldquo;official orders&rdquo; when the Department is in reality
      following out his directions.

    <h2>
      THE CASE OF THE POOL OF BLOOD IN THE PASTOR&rsquo;S STUDY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The sun rose slowly over the great bulk of the Carpathian mountains lying
      along the horizon, weird giant shapes in the early morning mist. It was
      still very quiet in the village. A cock crowed here and there, and
      swallows flew chirping close to the ground, darting swiftly about
      preparing for their higher flight. Janci the shepherd, apparently the only
      human being already up, stood beside the brook at the point where the old
      bridge spans the streamlet, still turbulent from the mountain floods.
      Janci was cutting willows to make his Margit a new basket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the shepherd raised his head from his work, for he thought he heard a
      loud laugh somewhere in the near distance. But all seemed silent and he
      turned back to his willows. The beauty of the landscape about him was much
      too familiar a thing that he should have felt or seen its charm. The
      violet hue of the distant woods, the red gleaming of the heather-strewn
      moor, with its patches of swamp from which the slow mist arose, the pretty
      little village with its handsome old church and attractive rectory&mdash;Janci
      had known it so long that he never stopped to realise how very charming,
      in its gentle melancholy, it all was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, Janci did not know that this little village of his home had once
      been a flourishing city, and that an invasion of the Turks had razed it to
      the ground leaving, as by a miracle, only the church to tell of former
      glories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose higher and higher. And now the village awoke to its daily
      life. Voices of cattle and noises of poultry were heard about the houses,
      and men and women began their accustomed round of tasks. Janci found that
      he had gathered enough willow twigs by this time. He tied them in a loose
      bundle and started on his homeward way.
    </p>
    <p>
      His path led through wide-stretching fields and vineyards past a little
      hill, some distance from the village, on which stood a large house. It was
      not a pleasant house to look at, not a house one would care to live in,
      even if one did not know its use, for it looked bare and repellant,
      covered with its ugly yellow paint, and with all the windows secured with
      heavy iron bars. The trees that surrounded it were tall and
      thick-foliaged, casting an added gloom over the forbidding appearance of
      the house. At the foot of the hill was a high iron fence, cutting off what
      lay behind it from all the rest of the world. For this ugly yellow house
      enclosed in its walls a goodly sum of hopeless human misery and
      misfortune. It was an insane asylum.
    </p>
    <p>
      For twenty years now, the asylum had stood on its hill, a source of
      superstitious terror to the villagers, but at the same time a source of
      added income. It meant money for them, for it afforded a constant and
      ever-open market for their farm products and the output of their home
      industry. But every now and then a scream or a harsh laugh would ring out
      from behind those barred windows, and those in the village who could hear,
      would shiver and cross themselves. Shepherd Janci had little fear of the
      big house. His little hut cowered close by the high iron gates, and he had
      a personal acquaintance with most of the patients, with all of the
      attendants, and most of all, with the kind elderly physician who was the
      head of the establishment. Janci knew them all, and had a kind word
      equally for all. But otherwise he was a silent man, living much within
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the shepherd reached his little home, his wife came to meet him with
      a call to breakfast. As they sat down at the table a shadow moved past the
      little window. Janci looked up. &ldquo;Who was that?&rdquo; asked Margit, looking up
      from her folded hands. She had just finished her murmured prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pastor&rsquo;s Liska,&rdquo; replied Janci indifferently, beginning his meal. (Liska
      was the local abbreviation for Elizabeth.)
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In such a hurry?&rdquo; thought the shepherd&rsquo;s wife. Her curiosity would not
      let her rest. &ldquo;I hope His Reverence isn&rsquo;t ill again,&rdquo; she remarked after a
      while. Janci did not hear her, for he was very busy picking a fly out of
      his milk cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think Liska was going for the old man?&rdquo; began Margit again after a
      few minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;old man&rdquo; was the name given by the people of the village, more as a
      term of endearment than anything else, to the generally loved and
      respected physician who was the head of the insane asylum. He had become
      general mentor and oracle of all the village and was known and loved by
      man, woman and child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s possible,&rdquo; answered Janci.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His Reverence didn&rsquo;t look very well yesterday, or maybe the old
      housekeeper has the gout again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janci gave a grunt which might have meant anything. The shepherd was a
      silent man. Being alone so much had taught him to find his own thoughts
      sufficient company. Ten minutes passed in silence since Margit&rsquo;s last
      question, then some one went past the window. There were two people this
      time, Liska and the old doctor. They were walking very fast, running
      almost. Margit sprang up and hurried to the door to look after them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janci sat still in his place, but he had laid aside his spoon and with
      wide eyes was staring ahead of him, murmuring, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pastor this time;
      I saw him&mdash;just as I did the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shepherd, the inn-keeper wants to see you, there&rsquo;s something the matter
      with his cow.&rdquo; Count &mdash;&mdash; a young man, came from the other
      direction and pushed in at the door past Margit, who stood there staring
      up the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Janci was so deep in his own thoughts that he apparently did not hear the
      boy&rsquo;s words. At all events he did not answer them, but himself asked an
      unexpected question&mdash;a question that was not addressed to the others
      in the room, but to something out and beyond them. It was a strange
      question and it came from the lips of a man whose mind was not with his
      body at that moment&mdash;whose mind saw what others did not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who will be the next to go? And who will be our pastor now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These were Janci&rsquo;s words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about, shepherd? Is it another one of your visions?&rdquo;
       exclaimed the young fellow who stood there before him. Janci rubbed his
      hands over his eyes and seemed to come down to earth with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that you, Ferenz? What do you want of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The boy gave his message again, and Janci nodded good-humouredly and
      followed him out of the house. But both he and his young companion were
      very thoughtful as they plodded along the way. The boy did not dare to ask
      any questions, for he knew that the shepherd was not likely to answer.
      There was a silent understanding among the villagers that no one should
      annoy Janci in any way, for they stood in a strange awe of him, although
      he was the most good-natured mortal under the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the shepherd and the boy walked toward the inn, the old doctor and
      Liska had hurried onward to the rectory. They were met at the door by the
      aged housekeeper, who staggered down the path wringing her hands, unable
      to give voice to anything but inarticulate expressions of grief and
      terror. The rest of the household and the farm hands were gathered in a
      frightened group in the great courtyard of the stately rectory which had
      once been a convent building. The physician hurried up the stairs into the
      pastor&rsquo;s apartments. These were high sunny and airy rooms with arched
      ceilings, deep window seats, great heavy doors and handsomely ornamented
      stoves. The simple modern furniture appeared still more plain and
      common-place by contrast with the huge spaces of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the rooms a gendarme was standing beside the window. The man
      saluted the physician, then shrugged his shoulders with an expression of
      hopelessness. The doctor returned a silent greeting and passed through
      into the next apartment. The old man was paler than usual and his face
      bore an expression of pain and surprise, the same expression that showed
      in the faces of those gathered downstairs. The room he now entered was
      large like the others, the walls handsomely decorated, and every corner of
      it was flooded with sunshine. There were two men in this room, the village
      magistrate and the notary. Their expression, as they held out their hands
      to the doctor, showed that his coming brought great relief. And there was
      something else in the room, something that drew the eyes of all three of
      the men immediately after their silent greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a great pool of blood which lay as a hideous stain on the
      otherwise clean yellow-painted floor. The blood must have flowed from a
      dreadful wound, from a severed artery even, the doctor thought, there was
      such a quantity of it. It had already dried and darkened, making its
      terrifying ugliness the more apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the third murder in two years,&rdquo; said the magistrate in a low
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the most mysterious of all of them,&rdquo; added the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;And there is not a trace of the body, you
      say?&mdash;or a clue as to where they might have taken the dead&mdash;or
      dying man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he looked carefully around the room, but there was no
      more blood to be seen anywhere. Any spot would have been clearly visible
      on the light-coloured floor. There was nothing else to tell of the
      horrible crime that had been committed here, nothing but the great,
      hideous, brown-red spot in the middle of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you made a thorough search for the body?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate shook his head. &ldquo;No, I have done nothing to speak of yet.
      We have been waiting for you. There is a gendarme at the gate; no one can
      go in or out without being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, then, let us begin our search now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The magistrate and his companion turned towards the door of the room but
      the doctor motioned them to come back. &ldquo;I see you do not know the house as
      well as I do,&rdquo; he said, and led the way towards a niche in the side of the
      wall, which was partially filled by a high bookcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah&mdash;that is the entrance of the passage to the church?&rdquo; asked the
      magistrate in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, this is it. The door is not locked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you believe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That the murderers came in from the church? Why not? It is quite
      possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To think of such a thing!&rdquo; exclaimed the notary with a shake of his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor laughed bitterly. &ldquo;To those who are planning a murder, a church
      is no more than any other place. There is a bolt here as you see. I will
      close this bolt now. Then we can leave the room knowing that no one can
      enter it without being seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The simple furniture of the study, a desk, a sofa, a couple of chairs and
      several bookcases, gave no chance of any hiding place either for the body
      of the victim or for the murderers. When the men left the room the
      magistrate locked the door and put the key in his own pocket. The gendarme
      in the neighbouring apartment was sent down to stand in the courtyard at
      the entrance to the house. The sexton, a little hunchback, was ordered to
      remain in the vestry at the other end of the passage from the church to
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the thorough search of the house began. Every room in both stories,
      every corner of the attic and the cellar, was looked over thoroughly. The
      stable, the barns, the garden and even the well underwent a close
      examination. There was no trace of a body anywhere, not even a trail of
      blood, nothing which would give the slightest clue as to how the murderers
      had entered, how they had fled, or what they had done with their victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great gate of the courtyard was closed. The men, reinforced by the
      farm hands, entered the church, while Liska and the dairy-maids huddled in
      the servants&rsquo; dining-room in a trembling group around the old housekeeper.
      The search in the church as well as in the vestry was equally in vain.
      There was no trace to be found there any more than in the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, during these hours of anxious seeking, the rumour of another
      terrible crime had spread through the village, and a crowd that grew from
      minute to minute gathered in front of the closed gates to the rectory, in
      front of the church, the closed doors of which did not open although it
      was a high feast day. The utter silence from the steeple, where the bells
      hung mute, added to the spreading terror. Finally the doctor came out from
      the rectory, accompanied by the magistrate, and announced to the waiting
      villagers that their venerable pastor had disappeared under circumstances
      which left no doubt that he had met his death at the hand of a murderer.
      The peasants listened in shuddering silence, the men pale-faced, the women
      sobbing aloud with frightened children hanging to their skirts. Then at
      the magistrate&rsquo;s order, the crowd dispersed slowly, going to their homes,
      while a messenger set off to the near-by county seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a weird, sad Easter Monday. Even nature seemed to feel the pressure
      of the brooding horror, for heavy clouds piled up towards noon and a chill
      wind blew fitfully from the north, bending the young corn and the creaking
      tree-tops, and moaning about the straw-covered roofs. Then an icy cold
      rain descended on the village, sending the children, the only humans still
      unconscious of the fear that had come on them all, into the houses to play
      quietly in the corner by the hearth.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing else spoken of wherever two or three met together
      throughout the village except this dreadful, unexplainable thing that had
      happened in the rectory. The little village inn was full to overflowing
      and the hum of voices within was like the noise of an excited beehive.
      Everyone had some new explanation, some new guess, and it was not until
      the notary arrived, looking even more important than usual, that silence
      fell upon the excited throng. But the expectations aroused by his coming
      were not fulfilled. The notary knew no more than the others although he
      had been one of the searchers in the rectory. But he was in no haste to
      disclose his ignorance, and sat wrapped in a dignified silence until some
      one found courage to question him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there nothing stolen?&rdquo; he was asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing as far as we can tell yet. But if it was the gypsies&mdash;as
      may be likely&mdash;they are content with so little that it would not be
      noticed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gypsies?&rdquo; exclaimed one man scornfully. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t have to be gypsies,
      we&rsquo;ve got enough tramps and vagabonds of our own. Didn&rsquo;t they kill the
      pedlar for the sake of a bag of tobacco, and old Katiza for a couple of
      hens?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you rake up things that happened twenty years ago?&rdquo; cried another
      over the table. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better tell us rather who killed Red Betty, and
      pulled Janos, the smith&rsquo;s farm hand, down into the swamp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or who cut the bridge supports, when the brook was in flood, so that
      two good cows broke through and drowned?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, if we only knew what band of robbers and villains it is that
      is ravaging our village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they haven&rsquo;t stopped yet, evidently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the worst misfortune of all! What will our poor do now that they
      have murdered our good pastor, who cared for us all like a father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He gave all he had to the poor, he kept nothing for himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed, that&rsquo;s how it was. And now we can&rsquo;t even give this good man
      Christian burial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shepherd Janci knew this morning early that we were going to have a new
      pastor,&rdquo; whispered the landlord in the notary&rsquo;s ear. The latter looked up
      astonished. &ldquo;Who said so?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy Ferenz, who went to fetch him about seven o&rsquo;clock. One of my cows
      was sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ferenz was sent for and told his story. The men listened with great
      interest, and the smith, a broad-shouldered elderly man, was particularly
      eager to hear, as he had always believed in the shepherd&rsquo;s power of second
      sight. The tailor, who was more modern-minded, laughed and made his jokes
      at this. But the smith laid one mighty hand on the other&rsquo;s shoulder,
      almost crushing the tailor&rsquo;s slight form under its weight, and said
      gravely: &ldquo;Friend, do you be silent in this matter. You&rsquo;ve come from other
      parts and you do not know of things that have happened here in days gone
      by. Janci can do more than take care of his sheep. One day, when my little
      girl was playing in the street, he said to me, &lsquo;Have a care of Maruschka,
      smith!&rsquo; and three days later the child was dead. The evening before Red
      Betty was murdered he saw her in a vision lying in a coffin in front of
      her door. He told it to the sexton, whom he met in the fields; and next
      morning they found Betty dead. And there are many more things that I could
      tell you, but what&rsquo;s the use; when a man won&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s only lost talk
      to try to make him. But one thing you should know: when Janci stares ahead
      of him without seeing what&rsquo;s in front of him, then the whole village
      begins to wonder what&rsquo;s going to happen, for Janci knows far more than all
      the rest of us put together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The smith&rsquo;s grave, deep voice filled the room and the others listened in a
      silence that gave assent to his words. He had scarcely finished speaking,
      however, when there was a noise of galloping hoofs and rapidly rolling
      wagon wheels. A tall brake drawn by four handsome horses dashed past in a
      whirlwind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the Count&mdash;the Count and the district judge,&rdquo; said the landlord
      in a tone of respect. The notary made a grab at his hat and umbrella and
      hurried from the room. &ldquo;That shows how much they thought of our pastor,&rdquo;
       continued the landlord proudly. &ldquo;For the Count himself has come and with
      four horses, too, to get here the more quickly. His Reverence was a great
      friend of the Countess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t make so much fuss over the pedlar and Betty,&rdquo; murmured the
      cobbler, who suffered from a perpetual grouch. But he followed the others,
      who paid their scores hastily and went out into the streets that they
      might watch from a distance at least what was going on in the rectory. The
      landlord bustled about the inn to have everything in readiness in case the
      gentlemen should honour him by taking a meal, and perhaps even lodgings,
      at his house. At the gate of the rectory the coachman and the maid Liska
      stood to receive the newcomers, just as five o&rsquo;clock was striking from the
      steeple.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should have been still quite light, but it was already dusk, for the
      clouds hung heavy. The rain had ceased, but a heavy wind came up which
      tore the delicate petals of the blossoms from the fruit trees and strewed
      them like snow on the ground beneath. The Count, who was the head of one
      of the richest and most aristocratic families in Hungary, threw off his
      heavy fur coat and hastened up the stairs at the top of which his old
      friend and confidant, the venerable pastor, usually came to meet him.
      To-day it was only the local magistrate who stood there, bowing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is incredible, incredible!&rdquo; exclaimed the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the man, leading the magnate through the
      dining-room into the pastor&rsquo;s study, where, as far as could be seen, the
      murder had been committed. They were joined by the district judge, who had
      remained behind to give an order sending a carriage to the nearest railway
      station. The judge, too, was serious and deeply shocked, for he also had
      greatly admired and revered the old pastor. The stately rectory had been
      the scene of many a jovial gathering when the lord of the manor had made
      it a centre for a day&rsquo;s hunting with his friends. The bearers of some of
      the proudest names in all Hungary had gathered in the high-arched rooms to
      laugh with the venerable pastor and to sample the excellent wines in his
      cellar. These wines, which the gentlemen themselves would send in as
      presents to the master of the rectory, would be carefully preserved for
      their own enjoyment. Not a landed proprietor for many leagues around but
      knew and loved the old pastor, who had now so strangely disappeared under
      such terrifying circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we might as well begin our examination,&rdquo; remarked the Count.
      &ldquo;Although if Dr. Orszay&rsquo;s sharp eyes did not find anything, I doubt very
      much if we will. You have asked the doctor to come here again, haven&rsquo;t
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your Grace! As soon as I saw you coming I sent the sexton to the
      asylum.&rdquo; Then the men went in again into the room which had been the scene
      of the mysterious crime. The wind rattled the open window and blew out its
      white curtains. It was already dark in the corners of the room, one could
      see but indistinctly the carvings of the wainscoting. The light backs of
      the books, or the gold letters on the darker bindings, made spots of
      brightness in the gloom. The hideous pool of blood in the centre of the
      floor was still plainly to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Judging by the loss of blood, death must have come quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was no struggle, evidently, for everything in the room was in
      perfect order when we entered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is not even a chair misplaced. His Bible is there on the desk, he
      may have been preparing for to-day&rsquo;s sermon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that is the case; because see, here are some notes in his
      handwriting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count and Judge von Kormendy spoke these sentences at intervals as
      they made their examination of the room. The local magistrate was able to
      answer one or two simpler questions, but for the most part he could only
      shrug his shoulders in helplessness. Nothing had been seen or heard that
      was at all unusual during the night in the rectory. When the old
      housekeeper was called up she could say nothing more than this. Indeed, it
      was almost impossible for the old woman to say anything, her voice choked
      with sobs at every second word. None of the household force had noticed
      anything unusual, or could remember anything at all that would throw light
      on this mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, sir, we might just as well sit down and wait for the
      detective&rsquo;s arrival,&rdquo; said the judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are waiting for some one besides the doctor?&rdquo; asked the local
      magistrate timidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, His Grace telegraphed to Budapest,&rdquo; answered the district judge,
      looking at his watch. &ldquo;And if the train is on time, the man we are waiting
      for ought to be here in an hour. You sent the carriage to the station,
      didn&rsquo;t you? Is the driver reliable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, he is a dependable man,&rdquo; said the old housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Orszay entered the room just then and the Count introduced him to the
      district judge, who was still a stranger to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear, Count, that our eyes will serve but little in discovering the
      truth of this mystery,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The nobleman nodded. &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And I have sent for
      sharper eyes than either yours or mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked his question, and the Count continued: &ldquo;When the news
      came to me I telegraphed to Pest for a police detective, telling them that
      the case was peculiar and urgent. I received an answer as I stopped at the
      station on my way here. This is it: &lsquo;Detective Joseph Muller from Vienna
      in Budapest by chance. Have sent him to take your case.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Muller?&rdquo; exclaimed Dr. Orszay. &ldquo;Can it be the celebrated Muller, the most
      famous detective of the Austrian police? That would indeed be a blessing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope and believe that it is,&rdquo; said the Count gravely. &ldquo;I have heard of
      this man and we need such a one here that we may find the source of these
      many misfortunes which have overwhelmed our peaceful village for two years
      past. It is indeed a stroke of good luck that has led a man of such gifts
      into our neighbourhood at a time when he is so greatly needed. I believe
      personally that it is the same person or persons who have been the
      perpetrators of all these outrages and I intend once for all to put a stop
      to it, let it cost what it may.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If any one can discover the truth it will be Muller,&rdquo; said the district
      judge. &ldquo;It was I who told the Count how fortunate we were that this man,
      who is known to the police throughout Austria and far beyond the borders
      of our kingdom, should have chanced to be in Budapest and free to come to
      us when we called. You and I&rdquo;&mdash;he turned with a smile to the local
      magistrate&mdash;&ldquo;you and I can get away with the usual cases of local
      brutality hereabouts. But the cunning that is at the bottom of these
      crimes is one too many for us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men had taken their places around the great dining-table. The old
      housekeeper had crept out again, her terror making her forget her usual
      hospitality. And indeed it would not have occurred to the guests to ask or
      even to wish for any refreshment. The maid brought a lamp, which sent its
      weak rays scarcely beyond the edges of the big table. The four men sat in
      silence for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it would be useless to ask who has been coming and going from
      the rectory the last few days?&rdquo; began the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the district judge with a sigh. &ldquo;For if this
      murderer is the same who committed the other crimes he must live here in
      or near the village, and therefore must be known to all and not likely to
      excite suspicion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rdquo; put in the doctor. &ldquo;There must be at least two
      of them. One man alone could not have carried off the farm hand who was
      killed to the swamp where his body was found. Nor could one man alone have
      taken away the bloody body of the pastor. Our venerable friend was a man
      of size and weight, as you know, and one man alone could not have dragged
      his body from the room without leaving an easily seen trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The judge blushed, but he nodded in affirmation to the doctor&rsquo;s words.
      This thought had not occurred to him before. In fact, the judge was more
      notable for his good will and his love of justice rather than for his keen
      intelligence. He was as well aware of this as was any one else, and he was
      heartily glad that the Count had sent to the capital for reinforcements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some time more passed in deep silence. Each of the men was occupied with
      his own thoughts. A sigh broke the silence now and then, and a slight
      movement when one or the other drew out his watch or raised his head to
      look at the door. Finally, the sound of a carriage outside was heard. The
      men sprang up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver&rsquo;s voice was heard, then steps which ascended the stairs lowly
      and lightly, audible only because the stillness was so great.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door opened and a small, slight, smooth-shaven man with a gentle face
      and keen grey eyes stood on the threshold. &ldquo;I am Joseph Muller,&rdquo; he said
      with a low, soft voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four men in the room looked at him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This simple-looking individual is the man that every one is afraid of?&rdquo;
       thought the Count, as he walked forward and held out his hand to the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sent for you, Mr. Muller,&rdquo; said the magnate, conscious of his stately
      size and appearance, as well as of his importance in the presence of a
      personage who so little looked what his great fame might have led one to
      expect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are Count &mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; answered Muller gently. &ldquo;I was in
      Budapest, having just finished a difficult case which took me there. They
      told me that a mysterious crime had happened in your neighbourhood, and
      sent me here to take charge of it. You will pardon any ignorance I may
      show as a stranger to this locality. I will do my best and it may be
      possible that I can help you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count introduced the other gentlemen in order and they sat down again
      at the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now what is it you want me for, Count?&rdquo; asked Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a murder committed in this house,&rdquo; answered the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is the victim?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our pastor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How was he killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not a physician, then?&rdquo; asked Muller, turning to Orszay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; answered the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The body is missing,&rdquo; said Orszay, somewhat sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Missing?&rdquo; Muller became greatly interested. &ldquo;Will you please lead me to
      the scene of the crime?&rdquo; he said, rising from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others led him into the next room, the magistrate going ahead with a
      lamp. The judge called for more lights and the group stood around the pool
      of blood on the floor of the study. Muller&rsquo;s arms were crossed on his
      breast as he stood looking down at the hideous spot. There was no terror
      in his eyes, as in those of the others, but only a keen attention and a
      lively interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who has been in this room since the discovery?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor replied that only the servants of the immediate household, the
      notary, the magistrate, and himself, then later the Count and the district
      judge entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are quite certain that no one else has been in here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kindly send for the three servants?&rdquo; The magistrate left the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who else lives in the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The sexton and the dairymaid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And no one else has left the house to-day or has entered it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one. The main door has been watched all day by a gendarme.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there but one door out of this room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there is a small door beside that bookcase.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does it lead to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It leads to a passageway at the end of which there is a stair down into
      the vestry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller gave an exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The vestry as well as the church have neither of them been opened on the
      side toward the street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The church or the vestry, you mean,&rdquo; corrected Muller. &ldquo;How many doors
      have they on the street side?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One each.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The locks on these doors were in good condition?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they were untouched.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there anything stolen from the church?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, nothing that we could see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was the pastor rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he was almost a poor man, for he gave away all that he had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you were his patron, Count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was his friend. He was the confidential adviser of myself and family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This would mean rich presents now and then, would it not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that is not the case. Our venerable pastor would take nothing for
      himself. He would accept no presents but gifts of money for his poor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you do not believe this to have been a murder for the sake of
      robbery?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. There was nothing disturbed in any part of the house, no drawers or
      cupboards broken open at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller smiled. &ldquo;I have heard it said that your romantic Hungarian bandits
      will often be satisfied with the small booty they may find in the pocket
      or on the person of their victim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are right, Mr. Muller. But that is only when they can find nothing
      else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or perhaps if it is a case of revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It cannot be revenge in this case!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pastor was greatly loved?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He was loved and revered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By every one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By every one!&rdquo; the four men answered at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller was still a while. His eyes were veiled and his face thoughtful.
      Finally he raised his head. &ldquo;There has been nothing moved or changed in
      this room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;neither here nor anywhere else in the house or the church,&rdquo;
       answered the local magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is good. Now I would like to question the servants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller had already started for the door, then he turned back into the room
      and pointing toward the second door he asked: &ldquo;Is that door locked?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Count. &ldquo;I found it locked when I examined it myself a
      short time ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was locked on the inside?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, locked on the inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Then we have nothing more to do here for the time being. Let
      us go back into the dining-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men returned to the dining-room, Muller last, for he stopped to lock
      the door of the study and put the key in his pocket. Then he began his
      examination of the servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old housekeeper, who, as usual, was the first to rise in the
      household, had also, as usual, rung the bell to waken the other servants.
      Then when Liska came downstairs she had sent her up to the pastor&rsquo;s room.
      His bedroom was to the right of the dining-room. Liska had, as usual,
      knocked on the door exactly at seven o&rsquo;clock and continued knocking for
      some few minutes without receiving any answer. Slightly alarmed, the girl
      had gone back and told the housekeeper that the pastor did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the old woman asked the coachman to go up and see if anything was the
      matter with the reverend gentleman. The man returned in a few moments,
      pale and trembling in every limb and apparently struck dumb by fright. He
      motioned the women to follow him, and all three crept up the stairs. The
      coachman led them first to the pastor&rsquo;s bed, which was untouched, and then
      to the pool of blood in his study. The sight of the latter frightened the
      servants so much that they did not notice at first that there was no sign
      of the pastor himself, whom they now knew must have been murdered. When
      they finally came to themselves sufficiently to take some action, the man
      hurried off to call the magistrate, and Liska ran to the asylum to fetch
      the old doctor; the pastor&rsquo;s intimate friend. The aged housekeeper,
      trembling in fear, crept back to her own room and sat there waiting the
      return of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the story of the early morning as told by the three servants, who
      had already given their report in much the same words to the Count on his
      arrival and also to the magistrate. There was no reason to doubt the words
      of either the old housekeeper or of Janos, the coachman, who had served
      for more than twenty years in the rectory and whose fidelity was known.
      The girl Liska was scarcely eighteen, and her round childish face and big
      eyes dimmed with tears, corroborated her story. When they had told Muller
      all they knew, the detective sat stroking his chin, and looking
      thoughtfully at the floor. Then he raised his head and said, in a tone of
      calm friendliness: &ldquo;Well, good friends, this will do for to-night. Now, if
      you will kindly give me a bite to eat and a glass of some light wine, I&rsquo;d
      be very thankful. I have had no food since early this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper and the maid disappeared, and Janos went to the stable to
      harness the Count&rsquo;s trap.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnate turned to the detective. &ldquo;I thank you once more that you have
      come to us. I appreciate it greatly that a stranger to our part of the
      country, like yourself, should give his time and strength to this problem
      of our obscure little village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is nothing else calling me, sir,&rdquo; answered Muller. &ldquo;And the
      Budapest police will explain to headquarters at Vienna if I do not return
      at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you understand our tongue sufficiently to deal with these people
      here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; there will be no difficulty about that. I have hunted criminals
      in Hungary before. And a case of this kind does not usually call for
      disguises in which any accent would betray one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a strange profession,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One gets used to it&mdash;like everything else,&rdquo; answered Muller, with a
      gentle smile. &ldquo;And now I have to thank you gentlemen for your confidence
      in me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which I know you will justify,&rdquo; said the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller shrugged his shoulders: &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t felt anything yet&mdash;but it
      will come&mdash;there&rsquo;s something in the air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Count smiled at his manner of expressing himself, but all four of the
      men had already begun to feel sympathy and respect for this quiet-mannered
      little person whose words were so few and whose voice was so gentle.
      Something in his grey eyes and in the quiet determination of his manner
      made them realise that he had won his fame honestly. With the enthusiasm
      of his race the Hungarian Count pressed the detective&rsquo;s hand in a warm
      grasp as he said: &ldquo;I know that we can trust in you. You will avenge the
      death of my old friend and of those others who were killed here. The
      doctor and the magistrate will tell you about them to-morrow. We two will
      go home now. Telegraph us as soon as anything has happened. Every one in
      the village will be ready to help you and of course you can call on me for
      funds. Here is something to begin on.&rdquo; With these words the Count laid a
      silk purse full of gold pieces on the table. One more pressure of the hand
      and he was gone. The other men also left the room, following the Count&rsquo;s
      lead in a cordial farewell of the detective. They also shared the
      nobleman&rsquo;s feeling that now indeed, with this man to help them, could the
      cloud of horror that had hung over the village for two years, and had
      culminated in the present catastrophe, be lifted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The excitement of the Count&rsquo;s departure had died away and the steps of the
      other men on their way to the village had faded in the distance. There was
      nothing now to be heard but the rustling of the leaves and the creaking of
      the boughs as the trees bent before the onrush of the wind. Muller stood
      alone, with folded arms, in the middle of the large room, letting his
      sharp eyes wander about the circle of light thrown by the lamps. He was
      glad to be alone&mdash;for only when he was alone could his brain do its
      best work. He took up one of the lamps and opened the door to the room in
      which, as far as could be known, the murder had been committed. He walked
      in carefully and, setting the lamp on the desk, examined the articles
      lying about on it. There was nothing of importance to be found there. An
      open Bible and a sheet of paper with notes for the day&rsquo;s sermon lay on top
      of the desk. In the drawers, none of which were locked, were official
      papers, books, manuscripts of former sermons, and a few unimportant
      personal notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The flame of the lamp flickered in the breeze that came from the open
      window. But Muller did not close the casement. He wanted to leave
      everything just as he had found it until daylight. When he saw that it was
      impossible to leave the lamp there he took it up again and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the use of being impatient?&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;If I move about
      in this poor light I will be sure to ruin some possible clue. For there
      must be some clue left here. It is impossible for even the most practiced
      criminal not to leave some trace of his presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective returned to the dining-room, locking the study door
      carefully behind him. The maid and the coachman returned, bringing in an
      abundant supper, and Muller sat down to do justice to the many good things
      on the tray. When the maid returned to take away the dishes she inquired
      whether she should put the guest chamber in order for the detective. He
      told her not to go to any trouble for his sake, that he would sleep in the
      bed in the neighbouring room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You going to sleep in there?&rdquo; said the girl, horrified.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my child, and I think I will sleep well to-night. I feel very
      tired.&rdquo; Liska carried the things out, shaking her head in surprise at this
      thin little man who did not seem to know what it was to be afraid. Half an
      hour later the rectory was in darkness. Before he retired, Muller had made
      a careful examination of the pastor&rsquo;s bedroom. Nothing was disturbed
      anywhere, and it was evident that the priest had not made any preparations
      for the night, but was still at work at his desk in the study when death
      overtook him. When he came to this conclusion, the detective went to bed
      and soon fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his little hut near the asylum gates, shepherd Janci slept as sound as
      usual. But he was dreaming and he spoke in his sleep. There was no one to
      hear him, for his faithful Margit was snoring loudly. Snatches of
      sentences and broken words came from Janci&rsquo;s lips: &ldquo;The hand&mdash;the big
      hand&mdash;I see it&mdash;at his throat&mdash;the face&mdash;the yellow
      face&mdash;it laughs&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the children on their way to school crept past the rectory
      with wide eyes and open mouths. And the grown people spoke in lower tones
      when their work led them past the handsome old house. It had once been
      their pride, but now it was a place of horror to them. The old housekeeper
      had succumbed to her fright and was very ill. Liska went about her work
      silently, and the farm servants walked more heavily and chattered less
      than they had before. The hump-backed sexton, who had not been allowed to
      enter the church and therefore had nothing to do, made an early start for
      the inn, where he spent most of the day telling what little he knew to the
      many who made an excuse to follow him there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only calm and undisturbed person in the rectory household was Muller.
      He had made a thorough examination of the entire scene of the murder, but
      had not found anything at all. Of one thing alone was he certain: the
      murderer had come through the hidden passageway from the church. There
      were two reasons to believe this, one of which might possibly not be
      sufficient, but the other was conclusive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy armchair before the desk, the chair on which the pastor was
      presumably sitting when the murderer entered, was half turned around,
      turned in just such a way as it would have been had the man who was
      sitting there suddenly sprung up in excitement or surprise. The chair was
      pushed back a step from the desk and turned towards the entrance to the
      passageway. Those who had been in the room during the day had reported
      that they had not touched any one of the articles of furniture, therefore
      the position of the chair was the same that had been given it by the man
      who had sat in it, by the murdered pastor himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there was always the possibility that some one had moved the
      chair without realising it. This clue, therefore, could not be looked upon
      as an absolutely certain one had it stood alone. But there was other
      evidence far more important. The great pool of blood was just half-way
      between the door of the passage and the armchair. It was here, therefore,
      that the attack had taken place. The pastor could not have turned in this
      direction in the hope of flight, for there was nothing here to give him
      shelter, no weapon that he could grasp, not even a cane. He must have
      turned in this direction to meet and greet the invader who had entered his
      room in this unusual manner. Turned to meet him as a brave man would, with
      no other weapon than the sacredness of his calling and his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this had not been enough to protect the venerable priest. The murderer
      must have made his thrust at once and his victim had sunk down dying on
      the floor of the room in which he had spent so many hours of quiet study,
      in which he had brought comfort and given advice to so many anxious
      hearts; for dying he must have been&mdash;it would be impossible for a man
      to lose so much blood and live.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The struggle,&rdquo; thought the detective, &ldquo;but was there a struggle?&rdquo; He
      looked about the room again, but could see nothing that showed disorder
      anywhere in its immaculate neatness. No, there could have been no
      struggle. It must have been a quick knife thrust and death at once. &ldquo;Not a
      shot?&rdquo; No, a shot would have been heard by the night watchman walking the
      streets near the church. The night was quiet, the window open. Some one in
      the village would have heard the noise of a shot. And it was not likely
      that the old housekeeper who slept in the room immediately below, slept
      the light sleep of the aged would have failed to have heard the firing of
      a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller took a chair and sat down directly in front of the pool of blood,
      looking at it carefully. Suddenly he bowed his head deeper. He had caught
      sight of a fine thread of the red fluid which had been drawn out for about
      a foot or two in the direction towards the door to the dining-room. What
      did that mean? Did it mean that the murderer went out through that door,
      dragging something after him that made this delicate line? Muller bent
      down still deeper. The sun shone brightly on the floor, sending its clear
      rays obliquely through the window. The sharp eyes which now covered every
      inch of the yellow-painted floor discovered something else. They
      discovered that this red thread curved slightly and had a continuation in
      a fine scratch in the paint of the floor. Muller followed up this scratch
      and it led him over towards the window and then back again in wide curves,
      then out again under the desk and finally, growing weaker and weaker, it
      came back to the neighbourhood of the pool of blood, but on the opposite
      side of it. Muller got down on his hands and knees to follow up the
      scratch. He did not notice the discomfort of his position, his eyes shone
      in excitement and a deep flush glowed in his cheeks. Also, he began to
      whistle softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph Muller, the bloodhound of the Austrian police, had found a clue, a
      clue that soon would bring him to the trail he was seeking. He did not
      know yet what he could do with his clue. But this much he knew; sooner or
      later this scratch in the floor would lead him to the murderer. The trail
      might be long and devious; but he would follow it and at its end would be
      success. He knew that this scratch had been made after the murder was
      committed; this was proved by the blood that marked its beginning. And it
      could not have been made by any of those who entered the room during the
      day because by that time the blood had dried. This strange streak in the
      floor, with its weird curves and spirals, could have been made only by the
      murderer. But how? With what instrument? There was the riddle which must
      be solved.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Muller, making another careful examination of the floor, found
      something else. It was something that might be utterly unimportant or
      might be of great value. It was a tiny bit of hardened lacquer which he
      found on the floor beside one of the legs of the desk. It was rounded out,
      with sharp edges, and coloured grey with a tiny zigzag of yellow on its
      surface. Muller lifted it carefully and looked at it keenly. This tiny bit
      of lacquer had evidently been knocked off from some convex object, but it
      was impossible to tell at the moment just what sort of an object it might
      have been. There are so many different things which are customarily
      covered with lacquer. However, further examination brought him down to a
      narrower range of subjects. For on the inside of the lacquer he found a
      shred of reddish wood fibre. It must have been a wooden object, therefore,
      from which the lacquer came, and the wood had been of reddish tinge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller pondered the matter for a little while longer. Then he placed his
      discovery carefully in the pastor&rsquo;s emptied tobacco-box, and dropped the
      box in his own pocket. He closed the window and the door to the
      dining-room, lit a lamp, and entered the passageway leading to the vestry.
      It was a short passageway, scarcely more than a dozen paces long.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls were whitewashed, the floor tiled and the entire passage shone
      in neatness. Muller held the light of his lamp to every inch of it, but
      there was nothing to show that the criminal had gone through here with the
      body of his victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The criminal&rdquo;&mdash;Muller still thought of only one. His long experience
      had taught him that the most intricate crimes were usually committed by
      one man only. The strength necessary for such a crime as this did not
      deceive him either. He knew that in extraordinary moments extraordinary
      strength will come to the one who needs it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He now passed down the steps leading into the vestry. There was no trace
      of any kind here either. The door into the vestry was not locked. It was
      seldom locked, they had told him, for the vestry itself was closed by a
      huge carved portal with a heavy ornamented iron lock that could be opened
      only with the greatest noise and trouble. This door was locked and closed
      as it had been since yesterday morning. Everything in the vestry was in
      perfect order; the priest&rsquo;s garments and the censers all in their places.
      Muller assured himself of this before he left the little room. He then
      opened the glass door that led down by a few steps into the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful old church, and it was a rich church also. It was built
      in the older Gothic style, and its heavy, broad-arched walls, its massive
      columns would have made it look cold and bare had not handsome tapestries,
      the gift of the lady of the manor, covered the walls. Fine old pictures
      hung here and there above the altars, and handsome stained glass windows
      broke the light that fell into the high vaulted interior. There were three
      great altars in the church, all of them richly decorated. The main altar
      stood isolated in the choir. In the open space behind it was the entrance
      to the crypt, now veiled in a mysterious twilight. Heavy silver
      candlesticks, three on a side, stood on the altar. The pale gold of the
      tabernacle door gleamed between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller walked through the silent church, in which even his light steps
      resounded uncannily. He looked into each of the pews, into the
      confessionals, he walked around all the columns, he climbed up into the
      pulpit, he did everything that the others had done before him yesterday.
      And as with them, he found nothing that would indicate that the murderer
      had spent any time in the church. Finally he turned back once more to the
      main altar on his way out. But he did not leave the church as he intended.
      His last look at the altar had showed him something that attracted his
      attention and he walked up the three steps to examine it more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he had seen was something unusual about one of the silver
      candlesticks. These candlesticks had three feet, and five of them were
      placed in such a way that the two front feet were turned toward the
      spectator. But on the end candlestick nearest Muller the single foot
      projected out to the front of the altar. This candlestick therefore had
      been set down hastily, not placed carefully in the order of things as were
      the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And not only this. The heavy wax candle which was in the candlestick was
      burned down about a finger&rsquo;s breadth more than the others, for these were
      all exactly of a height. Muller bent still nearer to the candlestick, but
      he saw that the dim light in the church was not sufficient. He went to one
      of the smaller side altars, took a candle from there, lit it with one of
      the matches that he found in his own pocket and returned with the burning
      candle to the main altar. The steps leading up to this altar were covered
      by a large rug with a white ground and a pattern of flowers. Looking
      carefully at it the detective saw a tiny brown spot, the mark of a burn,
      upon one of the white surfaces. Beside it lay a half used match.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walking around this carefully, Muller approached the candlestick that
      interested him and holding up his light he examined every inch of its
      surface. He found what he was looking for. There were dark red spots
      between the rough edges of the silver ornamentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then the body is somewhere around here,&rdquo; thought the detective and came
      down from the steps, still holding the burning candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked slowly to the back of the altar. There was a little table there
      such as held the sacred dishes for the communion service, and the little
      carpet-covered steps which the sexton put out for the pastor when he took
      the monstrance from the high-built tabernacle. That was all that was to be
      seen in the dark corner behind the altar. Holding his candle close to the
      floor Muller discovered an iron ring fastened to one of the big stone
      flags. This must be the entrance to the crypt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller tried to raise the flag and was astonished to find how easily it
      came up. It was a square of reddish marble, the same with which the entire
      floor of the church was tiled. This flag was very thin and could easily be
      raised and placed back against the wall. Muller took up his candle, too
      greatly excited to stop to get a stick for it. He felt assured that now he
      would soon be able to solve at least a part of the mystery. He climbed
      down the steps carefully and found that they led into the crypt as he
      supposed. They were kept spotlessly clean, as was the entire crypt as far
      as he could see it by the light of his flickering candle. He was not
      surprised to discover that the air was perfectly pure here. There must be
      windows or ventilators somewhere, this he knew from the way his candle
      behaved.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient vault had a high arched ceiling and heavy massive pillars. It
      was a subterranean repetition of the church above. There had evidently
      been a convent attached to this church at one time; for here stood a row
      of simple wooden coffins all exactly alike, bearing each one upon its lid
      a roughly painted cross surrounded by a wreath. Thus were buried the monks
      of days long past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller walked slowly through the rows of coffins looking eagerly to each
      side. Suddenly he stopped and stood still. His hand did not tremble but
      his thin face was pale&mdash;pale as that face which looked up at him out
      of one of the coffins. The lid of the coffin stood up against the wall and
      Muller saw that there were several other empty ones further on, waiting
      for their silent occupants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body in the open coffin before which Muller stood was the body of the
      man who had been missing since the day previous. He lay there quite
      peacefully, his hands crossed over his breast, his eyes closed, a line of
      pain about his lips. In the crossed fingers was a little bunch of dark
      yellow roses. At the first glance one might almost have thought that
      loving hands had laid the old pastor in his coffin. But the red stain on
      the white cloth about his throat, and the bloody disorder of his
      snow-white hair contrasted sadly with the look of peace on the dead face.
      Under his head was a white silk cushion, one of the cushions from the
      altar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller stood looking down for some time at this poor victim of a strange
      crime, then he turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to know one thing more: how the murderer had left the crypt. The
      flame of his candle told him, for it nearly went out in a gust of wind
      that came down the opening right above him. This was a window about three
      or four feet from the floor, protected by rusty iron bars which had been
      sawed through, leaving the opening free. It was a small window, but it was
      large enough to allow a man of much greater size than Muller to pass
      through it. The detective blew out his candle and climbed up onto the
      window sill. He found himself outside, in a corner of the churchyard. A
      thicket of heavy bushes grown up over neglected graves completely hid the
      opening through which he had come. There were thorns on these bushes and
      also a few scattered roses, dark yellow roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller walked thoughtfully through the churchyard. The sexton sat huddled
      in an unhappy heap at the gate. He looked up in alarm as he saw the
      detective walking towards him. Something in the stranger&rsquo;s face told the
      little hunchback that he had made a discovery. The sexton sprang up, his
      lips did not dare utter the question that his eyes asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have found him,&rdquo; said the detective gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hunchback sexton staggered, then recovered himself, and hurried away
      to fetch the magistrate and the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later the murdered pastor lay in state in the chief apartment of
      his home, surrounded by burning candles and high-heaped masses of flowers.
      But he still lay in the simple convent coffin and the little bunch of
      roses which his murderer had placed between his stiffening fingers had not
      been touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two days later the pastor was buried. The Count and his family led the
      train of numerous mourners and among the last was Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two after the funeral the detective sauntered slowly through the
      main street of the village. He was not in a very good humour, his answer
      to the greeting of those who passed him was short. The children avoided
      him, for with the keenness of their kind they recognised the fact that
      this usually gentle little man was not in possession of his habitual calm
      temper. One group of boys, playing with a top, did not notice his coming
      and Muller stopped behind them to look on. Suddenly a sharp whistle was
      heard and the boys looked up from their play, surprised at seeing the
      stranger behind them. His eyes were gleaming, and his cheeks were flushed,
      and a few bars of a merry tune came in a keen whistle from his lips as he
      watched the spirals made by the spinning top.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the boys could stop their play the detective had left the group and
      hastened onward to the little shop. He left it again in eager haste after
      having made his purchase, and hurried back to the rectory. The shop-keeper
      stood in the doorway looking in surprise at this grown man who came to buy
      a top. And at home in the rectory the old housekeeper listened in equal
      surprise to the humming noise over her head. She thought at first it might
      be a bee that had got in somehow. Then she realised that it was not quite
      the same noise, and having already concluded that it was of no use to be
      surprised at anything this strange guest might do, she continued reading
      her scriptures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upstairs in the pastor&rsquo;s study, Muller sat in the armchair attentively
      watching the gyrations of a spinning top. The little toy, started at a
      certain point, drew a line exactly parallel to the scratch on the floor
      that had excited his thoughts and absorbed them day and night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a top&mdash;a top&rdquo; repeated the detective to himself again and
      again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why I didn&rsquo;t think of that right away. Why, of course,
      nothing else could have drawn such a perfect curve around the room,
      unhindered by the legs of the desk. Only I don&rsquo;t see how a toy like that
      could have any connection with this cruel and purposeless murder. Why,
      only a fool&mdash;or a madman&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller sprang up from his chair and again a sharp shrill whistle came from
      his lips. &ldquo;A madman!&mdash;&rdquo; he repeated, beating his own forehead. &ldquo;It
      could only have been a madman who committed this murder! And the pastor
      was not the first, there were two other murders here within a
      comparatively short time. I think I will take advantage of Dr. Orszay&rsquo;s
      invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Muller and the doctor sat together in a summer-house,
      from the windows of which one could see the park surrounding the asylum to
      almost its entire extent. The park was arranged with due regard to its
      purpose. The eye could sweep through it unhindered. There were no bushes
      except immediately along the high wall. Otherwise there were beautiful
      lawns, flower beds and groups of fine old trees with tall trunks.
    </p>
    <p>
      As would be natural in visiting such a place Muller had induced the doctor
      to talk about his patients. Dr. Orszay was an excellent talker and
      possessed the power of painting a personality for his listeners. He was
      pleased and flattered by the evident interest with which the detective
      listened to his remarks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then your patients are all quite harmless?&rdquo; asked Muller thoughtfully,
      when the doctor came to a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all quite harmless. Of course, there is the man who strangely enough
      considers himself the reincarnation of the famous French murderer, the
      goldsmith Cardillac, who, as you remember, kept all Paris in a fervour of
      excitement by his crimes during the reign of Louis XIV. But in spite of
      his weird mania this man is the most good-natured of any. He has been shut
      up in his room for several days now. He was a mechanician by trade, living
      in Budapest, and an unsuccessful invention turned his mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he a large, powerful man?&rdquo; asked Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Orszay looked a bit surprised. &ldquo;Why do you ask that? He does happen to
      be a large man of considerable strength, but in spite of it I have no fear
      of him. I have an attendant who is invaluable to me, a man of such
      strength that even the fiercest of them cannot overcome him, and yet with
      a mind and a personal magnetism which they cannot resist. He can always
      master our patients mentally and physically&mdash;most of them are afraid
      of him and they know that they must do as he says. There is something in
      his very glance which has the power to paralyse even healthy nerves, for
      it shows the strength of will possessed by this man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is the name of this invaluable attendant?&rdquo; asked Muller with a
      strange smile which the doctor took to be slightly ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyuri Kovacz. You are amused at my enthusiasm? But consider my position
      here. I am an old man and have never been a strong man. At my age I would
      not have strength enough to force that little woman there&mdash;she thinks
      herself possessed and is quite cranky at times&mdash;to go to her own room
      when she doesn&rsquo;t want to. And do you see that man over there in the blue
      blouse? He is an excellent gardener but he believes himself to be
      Napoleon, and when he has his acute attacks I would be helpless to control
      him were it not for Gyuri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are not afraid of Cardillac?&rdquo; interrupted Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least. He is as good-natured as a child and as confiding. I
      can let him walk around here as much as he likes. If it were not for the
      absurd nonsense that he talks when he has one of his attacks, and which
      frightens those who do not understand him, I could let him go free
      altogether.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you never let him leave the asylum grounds?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I take him out with me very frequently. He is a man of
      considerable education and a very clever talker. It is quite a pleasure to
      be with him. That was the opinion of my poor friend also, my poor murdered
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pastor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The pastor. He often invited Cardillac to come to the rectory with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed. Then Cardillac knew the inside of the rectory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The pastor used to lend him books and let him choose them himself
      from the library shelves. The people in the village are very kind to my
      poor patients here. I have long since had the habit of taking some of the
      quieter ones with me down into the village and letting the people become
      acquainted with them. It is good for both parties. It gives the patients
      some little diversion, and it takes away the worst of the senseless fear
      these peasants had at first of the asylum and its inmates. Cardillac in
      particular is always welcome when he comes, for he brings the children all
      sorts of toys that he makes in his cell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective had listened attentively and once his eyes flashed and his
      lips shut tight as if to keep in the betraying whistle. Then he asked
      calmly: &ldquo;But the patients are only allowed to go out when you accompany
      them, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; the attendants take them out sometimes. I prefer, however, to let
      them go only with Gyuri, for I can depend upon him more than upon any of
      the others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then he and Cardillac have been out together occasionally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, quite frequently. But&mdash;pardon me&mdash;this is almost like
      a cross-examination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, doctor, it&rsquo;s a bad habit of mine. One gets so
      accustomed to it in my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; asked Doctor Orszay, turning to a fine-looking
      young man of superb build, who entered just then and stood by the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just wanted to announce, sir, that No. 302 is quiet again!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;302 is Cardillac himself, Mr. Muller, or to give him his right name,
      Lajos Varna,&rdquo; explained the doctor turning to his guest. &ldquo;He is the 302nd
      patient who has been received here in these twenty years. Then Cardillac
      is quiet again?&rdquo; he asked, looking up at the young giant. &ldquo;I am glad of
      that. You can announce our visit to him. This gentleman wants to inspect
      the asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller realised that this was the attendant Gyuri, and he looked at him
      attentively. He was soon clear in his own mind that this remarkably
      handsome man did not please him, in fact awoke in him a feeling of
      repulsion. The attendant&rsquo;s quiet, almost cat-like movements were in
      strange contrast to the massivity of his superb frame, and his large round
      eyes, shaped for open, honest glances, were shifty and cunning. They
      seemed to be asking &ldquo;Are you trying to discover anything about me?&rdquo;
       coupled with a threat. &ldquo;For your own sake you had better not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the young man had left the room Muller rose hastily and walked up and
      down several times. His face was flushed and his lips tight set. Suddenly
      he exclaimed: &ldquo;I do not like this Gyuri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Orszay looked up astonished. &ldquo;There are many others who do not like
      him&mdash;most of his fellow-warders for instance, and all of the
      patients. I think there must be something in the contrast of such quiet
      movements with such a big body that gets on people&rsquo;s nerves. But consider,
      Mr. Muller, that the man&rsquo;s work would naturally make him a little
      different from other people. I have known Gyuri for five years as a
      faithful and unassuming servant, always willing and ready for any duty,
      however difficult or dangerous. He has but one fault&mdash;if I may call
      it such&mdash;that is that he has a mistress who is known to be mercenary
      and hard-hearted. She lives in a neighbouring village.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For five years, you say? And how long has Cardillac been here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardillac? He has been here for almost three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For almost three years, and is it not almost three years&mdash;&rdquo; Muller
      interrupted himself. &ldquo;Are we quite alone? Is no one listening?&rdquo; The doctor
      nodded, greatly surprised, and the detective continued almost in a
      whisper, &ldquo;and it is just about three years now that there have been
      committed, at intervals, three terrible crimes notable from the cleverness
      with which they were carried out, and from the utter impossibility,
      apparently, of discovering the perpetrator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orszay sprang up. His face flushed and then grew livid, and he put his
      hand to his forehead. Then he forced a smile and said in a voice that
      trembled in spite of himself: &ldquo;Mr. Muller, your imagination is wonderful.
      And which of these two do you think it is that has committed these crimes&mdash;the
      perpetrator of which you have come here to find?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you that later. I must speak to No. 302 first, and I must
      speak to him in the presence of yourself and Gyuri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The detective&rsquo;s deep gravity was contagious. Dr. Orszay had sufficiently
      controlled himself to remember what he had heard in former days, and just
      now recently from the district judge about this man&rsquo;s marvellous deeds. He
      realised that when Muller said a thing, no matter how extravagant it might
      sound, it was worth taking seriously. This realisation brought great
      uneasiness and grief to the doctor&rsquo;s heart, for he had grown fond of both
      of the men on whom terrible suspicion was cast by such an authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller himself was uneasy, but the gloom that had hung over him for the
      past day or two had vanished. The impenetrable darkness that had
      surrounded the mystery of the pastor&rsquo;s murder had gotten on his nerves. He
      was not accustomed to work so long over a problem without getting some
      light on it. But now, since the chance watching of the spinning top in the
      street had given him his first inkling of the trail, he was following it
      up to a clear issue. The eagerness, the blissful vibrating of every nerve
      that he always felt at this stage of the game, was on him again. He knew
      that from now on what was still to be done would be easy. Hitherto his
      mind had been made up on one point; that one man alone was concerned in
      the crime. Now he understood the possibility that there might have been
      two, the harmless mechanician who fancied himself a dangerous murderer,
      and the handsome young giant with the evil eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men stood looking at each other in a silence that was almost
      hostile. Had this stranger come to disturb the peace of the refuge for the
      unfortunate and to prove that Dr. Orszay, the friend of all the village,
      had unwittingly been giving shelter to such criminals?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall we go now?&rdquo; asked the detective finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you wish it, sir,&rdquo; answered the doctor in a tone that was decidedly
      cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller held out his hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us be foolish, doctor. If you should
      find yourself terribly deceived, and I should have been the means of
      proving it, promise me that you will not be angry with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Orszay pressed the offered hand with a deep sigh. He realised the other&rsquo;s
      position and knew it was his duty to give him every possible assistance.
      &ldquo;What is there for me to do now?&rdquo; he asked sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must see that all the patients are shut up in their cells so that the
      other attendants are at our disposal if we need them. Varna&rsquo;s room has
      barred windows, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I suppose also that it has but one door. I believe you told me that
      your asylum was built on the cell system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is but one door to the room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let the four other attendants stand outside this door. Gyuri will be
      inside with us. Tell the men outside that they are to seize and hold
      whomever I shall designate to them. I will call them in by a whistle. You
      can trust your people?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have my revolver,&rdquo; said Muller calmly, &ldquo;and now we can go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the room together, and found Gyuri waiting for them a little
      further along the corridor. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you well, sir?&rdquo; the attendant asked
      the doctor, with an anxious note in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s anxiety was not feigned. He was really a faithful servant in his
      devotion to the old doctor, although Muller had not misjudged him when he
      decided that this young giant was capable of anything. Good and evil often
      lie so close together in the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor&rsquo;s emotion prevented him from speaking, and the detective
      answered in his place. &ldquo;It is a sudden indisposition,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Lead me
      to No. 302, who is waiting for us, I suppose. The doctor wants to lie down
      a moment in his own room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyuri glanced distrustfully at this man whom he had met for the first time
      to-day, but who was no stranger to him&mdash;for he had already learned
      the identity of the guest in the rectory. Then he turned his eyes on his
      master. The latter nodded and said: &ldquo;Take the gentleman to Varna&rsquo;s room. I
      will follow shortly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cell to which they went was the first one at the head of the
      staircase. &ldquo;Extremely convenient,&rdquo; thought Muller to himself. It was a
      large room, comfortably furnished and filled now with the red glow of the
      setting sun. A turning-lathe stood by the window and an elderly man was at
      work at it. Gyuri called to him and he turned and rose when he saw a
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lajos Varna was a tall, loose-jointed man with sallow skin and tired eyes.
      He gave only a hasty glance at his visitor, then looked at Gyuri. The
      expression in his eyes as he turned them on those of the warder was like
      the look in the eyes of a well-trained dog when it watches its master&rsquo;s
      face. Gyuri&rsquo;s brows were drawn close together and his mouth set tight to a
      narrow line. His eyes fairly bored themselves into the patient&rsquo;s eyes with
      an expression like that of a hypnotiser.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller knew now what he wanted to know. This young man understood how to
      bend the will of others, even the will of a sick mind, to his own desires.
      The little silent scene he had watched had lasted just the length of time
      it had taken the detective to walk through the room and hold out his hand
      to the patient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to disturb you, Mr. Varna,&rdquo; he said in a friendly tone, with
      a motion towards the bench from which the mechanician had just arisen.
      Varna sat down again, obedient as a child. He was not always so
      apparently, for Muller saw a red mark over the fingers of one hand that
      was evidently the mark of a blow. Gyuri was not very choice in the methods
      by which he controlled the patients confided to his care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I sit down also?&rdquo; asked Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varna pushed forward a chair. His movements were like those of an
      automaton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell me how you like it here?&rdquo; began the detective. Varna
      answered with a low soft voice, &ldquo;Oh, I like it very much, sir.&rdquo; As he
      spoke he looked up at Gyuri, whose eyes still bore their commanding
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They treat you kindly here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor is very good to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the doctor is so good!&rdquo; Varna&rsquo;s dull eyes brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the others are good to you also?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo; The momentary gleam in the sad eye had vanished again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you get this red scar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The patient became uneasy, he moved anxiously on his chair and looked up
      at Gyuri. It was evident that he realised there would be more red marks if
      he told the truth to this stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller did not insist upon an answer. &ldquo;You are uneasy and nervous
      sometimes, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I have been&mdash;nervous&mdash;lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they don&rsquo;t let you go out at such times?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I&mdash;no, I may not go out at such times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the doctor takes you with him sometimes&mdash;the doctor or Gyuri?&rdquo;
       asked the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had him out with me for weeks,&rdquo; interrupted the attendant. He
      seemed particularly anxious to have the &ldquo;for weeks&rdquo; clearly heard by this
      inconvenient questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller dropped this subject and took up another. &ldquo;They tell me you are
      very fond of children, and I can see that you are making toys for them
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I love children, and I am so glad they are not afraid of me.&rdquo; These
      words were spoken with more warmth and greater interest than anything the
      man had yet said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And they tell me that you take gifts with you for the children every time
      you go down to the village. This is pretty work here, and it must be a
      pleasant diversion for you.&rdquo; Muller had taken up a dainty little
      spinning-wheel which was almost completed. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it made from the wood of
      a red yew tree?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, the doctor gave me a whole tree that had been cut down in the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that gave you wood for a long time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed; I have been making toys from it for months.&rdquo; Varna had
      become quite eager and interested as he handed his visitor a number of
      pretty trifles. The two had risen from their chairs and were leaning over
      the wide window seat which served as a store-house for the wares turned
      out by the busy workman. They were toys, mostly, all sorts of little pots
      and plates, dolls&rsquo; furniture, balls of various sizes, miniature bowling
      pins, and tops. Muller took up one of the latter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very clever you are, and how industrious,&rdquo; he exclaimed, sitting down
      again and turning the top in his hands. It was covered with grey varnish
      with tiny little yellow stripes painted on it. Towards the lower point a
      little bit of the varnish had been broken off and the reddish wood
      underneath was visible. The top was much better constructed than the cheap
      toys sold in the village. It was hollow and contained in its interior a
      mechanism started by a pressure on the upper end. Once set in motion the
      little top spun about the room for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, isn&rsquo;t that pretty! Is this mechanism your own invention?&rdquo; asked
      Muller smiling. Gyuri watched the top with drawn brows and murmured
      something about &ldquo;childish foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is my own invention,&rdquo; said the patient, flattered. He started out
      on an absolutely technical explanation of the mechanism of tops in general
      and of his own in particular, an explanation so lucid and so well put that
      no one would have believed the man who was speaking was not in possession
      of the full powers of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller listened very attentively with unfeigned interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have made more important inventions than this, haven&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
      asked when the other stopped talking. Varna&rsquo;s eyes flashed and his voice
      dropped to a tone of mystery as he answered: &ldquo;Yes indeed I have. But I did
      not have time to finish them. For I had become some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one else?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardillac,&rdquo; whispered Varna, whose mania was now getting the best of him
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cardillac? You mean the notorious goldsmith who lived in Paris 200 years
      ago? Why, he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varna&rsquo;s pale lips curled in a superior smile. &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;that&rsquo;s what
      people think, but it&rsquo;s a mistake. He is still alive&mdash;I am&mdash;I
      have&mdash;although of course there isn&rsquo;t much opportunity here&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gyuri cleared his throat with a rasping noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were you saying, friend Cardillac?&rdquo; asked Muller with a great show
      of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done things here that nobody has found out. It gives me great
      pleasure to see the authorities so helpless over the riddles I have given
      them to solve. Oh, indeed, sir, you would never imagine how stupid they
      are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In other words, friend Cardillac, you are too clever for the authorities
      here?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; said the insane man greatly flattered. He raised his
      head proudly and smiled down at his guest. At this moment the doctor came
      into the room and Gyuri walked forward to the group at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are making him nervous, sir,&rdquo; he said to Muller in a tone that was
      almost harsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can leave that to me,&rdquo; answered the detective calmly. &ldquo;And you will
      please place yourself behind Mr. Varna&rsquo;s chair, not behind mine. It is
      your eyes that are making him uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The attendant was alarmed and lost control of himself for a moment. &ldquo;Sir!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed in an outburst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Muller, in case you do not know it already, Joseph Muller,
      detective. Gyuri Kovacz, you will do what I tell you to! I am master here
      just now. Is it not so, doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it is so,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; murmured Gyuri, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It means that the best thing for you to do is to stand up against that
      wall and fold your arms on your breast,&rdquo; said Muller firmly. He took a
      revolver from his pocket and laid it beside him on the turning-lathe. The
      young giant, cowed by the sight of the weapon, obeyed the commands of this
      little man whom he could have easily crushed with a single blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Orszay sank down on the chair beside the door. Muller, now completely
      master of the situation, turned to the insane man who stood looking at him
      in a surprise which was mingled with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, my dear Cardillac, you must tell us of your great deeds here,&rdquo;
       said the detective in a friendly tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unfortunate man bent over him with shining eyes and whispered: &ldquo;But
      you&rsquo;ll shoot him first, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I shoot him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he won&rsquo;t let me say a word without beating me. He is so cruel. He
      sticks pins into me if I don&rsquo;t do what he wants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell the doctor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyuri would have treated me worse than ever then. I am a coward, sir, I&rsquo;m
      so afraid of pain and he knew that&mdash;he knew that I was afraid of
      being hurt and that I&rsquo;d always do what he asked of me. And because I don&rsquo;t
      like to be hurt myself I always finished them off quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finished who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, there was Red Betty, he wanted her money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who wanted it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gyuri.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man at the wall moved when he heard this terrible accusation. But the
      detective took up his revolver again. &ldquo;Be quiet there!&rdquo; he called, with a
      look such as he might have thrown at an angry dog. Gyuri stood quiet again
      but his eyes shot flames and great drops stood out on his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now go on, friend Cardillac,&rdquo; continued the detective. &ldquo;We were talking
      about Red Betty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I strangled her. She did not even know she was dying. She was such a weak
      old woman, it really couldn&rsquo;t have hurt her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; said Muller soothingly, for he saw that the thought
      that his victim might have suffered was beginning to make the madman
      uneasy. &ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t worry about that. Old Betty died a quiet death. But
      tell me, how did Gyuri know that she had money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whole village knew it. She laid cards for people and earned a lot of
      money that way. She was very stingy and saved every bit. Somebody saw her
      counting out her money once, she had it in a big stocking under her bed.
      People in the village talked about it. That&rsquo;s how Gyuri heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so he commanded you to kill Betty and steal her money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He knew that I loved to give them riddles to guess, just as I did in
      Paris so long ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you&rsquo;re Cardillac, aren&rsquo;t you? And now tell us about the smith&rsquo;s
      swineherd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Janos? Oh, he was a stupid lout,&rdquo; answered Varna scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had cast an eye on the beautiful Julcsi, Gyuri&rsquo;s mistress, so of
      course I had to kill him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you do that alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Gyuri helped me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you cut the bridge supports?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I enjoy giving people riddles, as I told you. But Gyuri forbade
      me to kill people uselessly. I liked the chance of getting out though. The
      doctor&rsquo;s so good to me and the others too. Gyuri is good to me when I have
      done what he wanted. But you see, Mr. Muller, I am like a prisoner here
      and that makes me angry. I made Gyuri let me out nights sometimes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he let you out alone, all alone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, of course, for I threatened to tell the doctor everything if he
      didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t have dared do that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; smiled Varna slyly. &ldquo;But Gyuri was afraid I might do
      it, for he isn&rsquo;t always strong enough to frighten me with his eyes. Those
      were the hours when I could make him afraid&mdash;I liked those hours&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do when you were out alone at night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just walked about. I set fire to a tree in the woods once, then the
      rain came and put it out. Once I killed a dog and another time I cut
      through the bridge supports. That took me several hours to do and made me
      very tired. But it was such fun to know that people would be worrying and
      fussing about who did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varna rubbed his hands gleefully. He did not look the least bit malicious
      but only very much amused. The doctor groaned. Gyuri&rsquo;s great body
      trembled, his arms shook, but he did not make a single voluntary movement.
      He saw the revolver in Muller&rsquo;s hand and felt the keen grey eyes resting
      on him in pitiless calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell us about the pastor?&rdquo; said the detective in a firm clear
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he was a dear, good gentleman,&rdquo; said No. 302 with an expression of
      pitying sorrow on his face. &ldquo;I owed him much gratitude; that&rsquo;s why I put
      the roses in his hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but you murdered him first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, Gyuri told me to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He hated the pastor, for the old gentleman had no confidence in him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this true?&rdquo; Muller turned to the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did not notice it,&rdquo; said Orszay with a voice that showed deep sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; Muller&rsquo;s eyes bored themselves into the orbs of the young
      giant, now dulled with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gyuri started and shivered. &ldquo;He looked at me sharply every now and then,&rdquo;
       he murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that was why he was killed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The warder&rsquo;s head sank on his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not only for that reason,&rdquo; continued No. 302. &ldquo;Gyuri needed money
      again. He ordered me to bring him the silver candlesticks off the altar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Murder and sacrilege,&rdquo; said the detective calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I did not rob the church. When I had buried the reverend gentleman I
      heard the cock crowing. I was afraid I might get home here too late and I
      forgot the candlesticks. I had to stop to wash my hands in the brook.
      While I was there I saw shepherd Janci coming along and I hid behind the
      willows. He almost discovered me once, but Janci&rsquo;s a dreamer, he sees
      things nobody else sees&mdash;and he doesn&rsquo;t see things that everybody
      else does see. I couldn&rsquo;t help laughing at his sleepy face. But I didn&rsquo;t
      laugh when I came back to the asylum. Gyuri was waiting for me at the
      door. When he saw that I hadn&rsquo;t brought the candlesticks he beat me and
      tortured me worse than he&rsquo;d ever done before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you didn&rsquo;t tell anyone?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; because I was afraid that if I told on him, I&rsquo;d never be able to
      go out again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, quite alone, could carry the pastor&rsquo;s body out of his room?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very strong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you arrange it that there should be no traces of blood to betray
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I waited until the body had stiffened, then I tied up the wound and
      carried him down into the crypt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you do that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to leave him in that horrid pool of blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were sorry for him then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes; it looked so horrid to see him lying there&mdash;and he had
      always been so good to me. He was so good to me that very evening when I
      entered his study.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He recognised you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. He sprang up from his chair when I came in through the passage
      from the church. I saw that he was startled, but he smiled at me and
      reached out his hand to me and said: &lsquo;What brings you here, my dear
      Cardillac?&rsquo; And then I struck. I wanted him to die with that smile on his
      lips. It is beautiful to see a man die smiling, it shows that he has not
      been afraid of death. He was dead at once. I always kill that way&mdash;I
      know just how to strike and where. I killed more than a hundred people
      years ago in Paris, and I didn&rsquo;t leave one of them the time for even a
      sigh. I was renowned for that&mdash;I had a kind heart and a sure hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller interrupted the dreadful imaginings of the madman with a question.
      &ldquo;You got into the house through the crypt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, through the crypt. I found the window one night when I was prowling
      around in the churchyard. When I knew that the pastor was to be the next,
      I cut through the window bars. Gyuri went into the church one day when
      nobody was there and found out that it was easy to lift the stone over the
      entrance to the crypt. He also learned that the doors from the church to
      the vestry were never locked. I knew how to find the passageway, because I
      had been through it several times on my visits to the rectory. But it was
      a mere chance that the door into the pastor&rsquo;s study was unlocked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A chance that cost the life of a worthy man,&rdquo; said the detective gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varna nodded sadly. &ldquo;But he didn&rsquo;t suffer, he was dead at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now tell me what this top was doing there?&rdquo; No. 302 looked at the
      detective in great surprise, and then laid his hand on the latter&rsquo;s arm.
      &ldquo;How did you know that I had the top there?&rdquo; he asked with a show of
      interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I found its traces in the room, and it was those traces that led me here
      to you,&rdquo; answered Muller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How strange!&rdquo; remarked Varna. &ldquo;Are you like shepherd Janci that you can
      see the things others don&rsquo;t see?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I have not Janci&rsquo;s gift. It would be a great comfort to me and a help
      to the others perhaps if I had. I can only see things after they have
      happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can see more than others&mdash;the others did not see the traces
      of the top?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My business is to see more than others see,&rdquo; said Muller. &ldquo;But you have
      not told me yet what the top was doing there. Why did you take a toy like
      that with you when you went out on such an errand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was in my pocket by chance. When I reached for my handkerchief to
      quench the flow of blood the top came out with it. I must have touched the
      spring without knowing it, for the top began to spin. I stood still and
      watched it, then I ran after it. It spun around the room and finally came
      back to the body. So did I. The pastor was quite still and dead by that
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have heard everything, Dr. Orszay?&rdquo; asked the detective, rising from
      his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I have heard everything,&rdquo; answered the venerable head of the asylum.
      He was utterly crushed by the realisation that all this tragedy and horror
      had gone out from his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varna rose also. He understood perfectly that now Gyuri&rsquo;s power was at an
      end and he was as pleased as a child that has just received a present.
      &ldquo;And now you&rsquo;re going to shoot him?&rdquo; he asked, in the tone a boy would use
      if asking when the fireworks were to begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Muller shook his head. &ldquo;No, my dear Cardillac,&rdquo; he replied gravely. &ldquo;He
      will not be shot&mdash;that is a death for a brave soldier&mdash;but this
      man has deserved&mdash;&rdquo; He did not finish the sentence, for the warder
      sank to the floor unconscious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a coward!&rdquo; murmured the detective scornfully, looking down at the
      giant frame that lay prostrate before him. Even in his wide experience he
      had known of no case of a man of such strength and such bestial cruelty,
      combined with such utter cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Varna also stood looking down at the unconscious warder. Then he glanced
      up with a cunning smile at the other two men who stood there. The doctor,
      pale and trembling with horror, covered his face with his hands. Muller
      turned to the door to call in the attendants waiting outside. During the
      moment&rsquo;s pause that ensued the madman bent over his worktable, seized a
      knife that lay there and dropped on one knee beside the prostrate form.
      His hand was raised to strike when a calm voice said: &ldquo;Fie! Cardillac, for
      shame! Do not belittle yourself. This man here is not worthy of your
      knife, the hangman will look after him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Varna raised his loose-jointed frame and looked about with glistening eyes
      and trembling lips. His mind was completely darkened once more. &ldquo;I must
      kill him&mdash;I must have his blood&mdash;there is no one to see me,&rdquo; he
      murmured. &ldquo;I am a hangman too&mdash;he has made a hangman of me,&rdquo; and
      again he bent with uplifted hand over the man who had utilised his
      terrible misfortune to make a criminal of him. But two of the waiting
      attendants seized his arms and threw him back on the floor, while the
      other two carted Gyuri out. Both unfortunates were soon securely guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do not be angry with me, doctor,&rdquo; said Muller gravely, as he walked
      through the garden accompanied by Orszay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Orszay laughed bitterly. &ldquo;Why should I be angry with you&mdash;you
      who have discovered my inexcusable credulity?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Inexcusable? Oh, no, doctor; it was quite natural that you should have
      believed a man who had himself so well in hand, and who knew so well how
      to play his part. When we come to think of it, we realise that most crimes
      have been made possible through some one&rsquo;s credulity, or over-confidence,
      a credulity which, in the light of subsequent events, seems quite
      incomprehensible. Do not reproach yourself and do not lose heart. Your
      only fault was that you did not recognise the heart of the beast of prey
      in this admirable human form.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What course will the law take?&rdquo; asked Orszay. &ldquo;The poor unfortunate
      madman&mdash;whose knife took all these lives&mdash;cannot be held
      responsible, can he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; his misfortune protects him. But as for the other, though his
      hands bear no actual bloodstains, he is more truly a murderer than the
      unhappy man who was his tool. Hanging is too good for him. There are times
      when even I could wish that we were back in the Middle Ages, when it was
      possible to torture a prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do not look like that sort of a man,&rdquo; smiled the doctor through his
      sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am the most good-natured of men usually, I think&mdash;the meekest
      anyway,&rdquo; answered Muller. &ldquo;But a case like this&mdash;. However, as I said
      before, keep a stout heart, doctor, and do not waste time in unnecessary
      self-reproachings.&rdquo; The detective pressed the doctor&rsquo;s hand warmly and
      walked down the hill towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went at once to the office of the magistrate and made his report, then
      returned to the rectory and packed his grip. He arranged for its transport
      to the railway station, as he himself preferred to walk the inconsiderable
      distance. He passed through the village and had just entered the open
      fields when he met Janci with his flock. The shepherd hastened his steps
      when he saw the detective approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have found him, sir?&rdquo; he exclaimed as he came up to Muller. The men
      had come to be friends by this time. The silent shepherd with the power of
      second sight had won Muller&rsquo;s interest at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I found him. It is Gyuri, the warder at the asylum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, it is not Gyuri&mdash;Gyuri did not do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when I tell you that he did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I tell you, sir, that Gyuri did not do it. The man who did it&mdash;he
      has yellowish hands&mdash;I saw them&mdash;I saw big yellowish hands.
      Gyuri&rsquo;s hands are big, but they are brown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Janci, you are right. I was only trying to test you. Gyuri did not do it;
      that is, he did not do it with his own hands. The man who held the knife
      that struck down the pastor was Varna, the crazy mechanician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Janci beat his forehead. &ldquo;Oh, I am a foolish and useless dreamer!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed; &ldquo;of course it was Varna&rsquo;s hands that I saw. I have seen them a
      hundred times when he came down into the village, and yet when I saw them
      in the vision I did not recognise them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&rsquo;re all dreamers, Janci&mdash;and our dreams are very useless
      generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours are not useless, sir,&rdquo; said the shepherd. &ldquo;If I had as much brains
      as you have, my dreams might be of some good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Muller smiled. &ldquo;And if I had your visions, Janci, it would be a powerful
      aid to me in my profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you need them, sir. You can find out the hidden things
      without them. You are going to leave us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Janci, I must go back to Budapest, and from there to Vienna. They
      need me on another case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a sad work, this bringing people to the gallows, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Janci, it is sometimes. But it&rsquo;s a good thing to be able to avenge
      crime and bring justice to the injured. Good-bye, Janci.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, sir, and God speed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd stood looking after the small, slight figure of the man who
      walked on rapidly through the heather. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the right one for the work,&rdquo;
       murmured Janci as he turned slowly back towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later Muller stood in the little waiting-room of the railway
      station writing a telegram. It was addressed to Count &mdash;&mdash;.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  &ldquo;Do you know the shepherd Janci?  It would be a good thing to
  make him the official detective for the village.  He has high
  qualifications for the profession.  If I had his gifts combined
  with my own, not one could escape me.  I have found this one
  however.  The guards are already taking him to you.  My work
  here is done.  If I should be needed again I can be found at
  Police Headquarters, Vienna.
                                                  &ldquo;Respectfully,
                                                  &ldquo;JOSEPH MULLER.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      While the detective was writing his message&mdash;it was one of the rare
      moments of humour that Muller allowed himself, and he wondered mildly what
      the stately Hungarian nobleman would think of it&mdash;a heavy farm wagon
      jolted over the country roads towards the little county seat. Sitting
      beside the driver and riding about the wagon were armed peasants. The
      figure of a man, securely bound, his face distorted by rage and fear, lay
      in the wagon. It was Gyuri Kovacz, who had murdered by the hands of
      another, and who was now on his way to meet the death that was his due.
    </p>
    <p>
      And at one of the barred windows in the big yellow house stood a
      sallow-faced man, looking out at the rising moon with sad, tired eyes. His
      lips were parted in a smile like that of a dreaming child, and he hummed a
      gentle lullaby.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his compartment of the express from Budapest to Vienna, Joseph Muller
      sat thinking over the strange events that had called him to the obscure
      little Hungarian village. He had met with many strange cases in his long
      career, but this particular case had some features which were unique.
      Muller&rsquo;s lips set hard and his hands tightened to fists as he murmured:
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve met with criminals who used strange tools, but never before have I
      met with one who had the cunning and the incredible cruelty to utilise the
      mania of an unhinged human mind. It is a thousand times worse than those
      criminals who, now and then throughout the ages, have trained brute beasts
      to murder for them. Truly, this Hungarian peasant, Gyuri Kovacz, deserves
      a high place in the infamous roll-call of the great criminals of history.
      A student of crime might almost be led to think that it is a pity his
      career has been cut short so soon. He might have gone far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But for humanity&rsquo;s sake&rdquo; (Muller&rsquo;s eyes gleamed), &ldquo;I am thankful that I
      was able to discover this beast in human form and render him innocuous; he
      had done quite enough.&rdquo;
     </p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
